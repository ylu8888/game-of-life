## Step 7: for loop syntax.
    # On the blank line below, write a for statement that iterates variable r over the range specified by rows. (Note: rows is already defined above.)
    # Note: Make sure that the statement is properly indented. Your first for statement should line up with the hashtag at the beginning of this line.

## Step 8: for loop syntax

## Step 9: The line below specifies the color of your living cells.
##         Manipulate the R,G,B values so that your living cells are purple.
                grid_visual[r][c].setFill(color_rgb(128,0,128)) # This starting color is green. What are the R,G,B values for purple?

                grid_visual[r][c].setFill(color_rgb(0,0,0))

grid = create_grid(50,50)
grid_visual = create_grid_visual(50,50,window)
populate(grid,0.3)
## Step 10: The line above sets the initial state of the game.
#          This function tells Python to populate grid in such a way that each call has a 50% chance
#          of being alive in the initial state. Run the program and make a note to yourself about the
#          population density at the start of the game. The initial chance rate is indicated by the second
#          input: .5. Try retuning the initial rate and see what happens. Make a note to yourself.
#          Before you submit this assignment to Brightspace, set the input so that each cell has a
#          30% chance of being alive in the initial state.

# The line below indicates the range of generations through which the game will iterate.
# Currently, the game is set to run through 500 generations. If you want to see what happens
# with different numbers of generations, you can change the range from 500 to a different
# number. However, before you submit the assignment to Brightspace, make sure that the generation range
# is are set back to 500.
for generation in range(500):
    mirror(grid, grid_visual)
    window.update()
    grid = evolve(grid)
    time.sleep(0.25)

# In case you want to play around with it further!:
# The time.sleep(0.5) statement above sets the speed of each generation.
# Currently, the game will iterate through a generation in .5 seconds.
# If you want to slow the game down, you can make the number bigger.
# For instance, time.sleep(1) will give you one second between each generation.
# If you want to speed it up, you can make the number smaller.
# For instance, time.sleep(.25) will give you .25 seconds between each generation.
